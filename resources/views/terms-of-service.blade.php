                            <h5>Limitation of Liability</h5>
                            <p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Unikwork
                                Systems and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your
                                exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid
                                by you for the website.</p>
                            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Unikwork Systems or
                                its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages
                                whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data
                                or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of
                                privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the
                                website, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the website, or
                                otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Unikwork Systems
                                or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the
                                remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
                            <p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
                                consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>

                            <h5>Severability</h5>
                            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision
                                will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the
                                greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue
                                in full force and effect.</p>
                            <p>This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by
                                Unikwork Systems on the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and
                                Unikwork Systems concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed
                                invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not
                                affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in
                                full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further
                                or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Unikwork Systems's failure to
                                assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
                                right or provision. YOU AND Unikwork Systems AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT
                                OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF
                                ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

                            <h5>Waiver</h5>
                            <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of
                                an obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such
                                right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a
                                breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
                            <p>o failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right
                                or any power under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor
                                shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power under this Agreement preclude
                                further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the event of a conflict
                                between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this
                                Agreement shall govern.</p>

                            <h5>Amendments to this Agreement</h5>
                            <p>Unikwork Systems reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this
                                Agreement at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days'
                                notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be
                                determined at our sole discretion.</p>
                            <p>By continuing to access or use our website after any revisions become effective, you
                                agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no
                                longer authorized to use Unikwork Systems.</p>

                            <h5>Entire Agreement</h5>
                            <p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Unikwork Systems regarding
                                your use of the website and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral
                                agreements between you and Unikwork Systems.</p>
                            <p>You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that apply when you use or purchase
                                other Unikwork Systems's services, which Unikwork Systems will provide to you at the
                                time of such use or purchase.</p>

                            <h5>Updates to Our Terms</h5>
                            <p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so
                                that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law,
                                we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these
                                Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if
                                you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not
                                want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account.</p>

                            <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
                            <p>The website and its entire contents, features and functionality (including but not
                                limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the
                                design, selection and arrangement thereof), are owned by Unikwork Systems, its licensors
                                or other providers of such material and are protected by IN and international copyright,
                                trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights
                                laws. The material may not be copied, modified, reproduced, downloaded or distributed in

                                Systems, unless and except as is expressly provided in these Terms & Conditions. Any

                            <h5>Agreement to Arbitrate</h5>
                            <p>This section applies to any dispute EXCEPT IT DOESN’T INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO
                                CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE OR EQUITABLE RELIEF REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR
                                OR Unikwork Systems's INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The term “dispute” means any
                                dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Unikwork Systems concerning the
                                Services or this agreement, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation,
                                ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest
                                possible meaning allowable under law.</p>

                            <h5>Notice of Dispute</h5>
                            <p>In the event of a dispute, you or Unikwork Systems must give the other a Notice of
                                Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact
                                information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief
                                requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute via email to info@unikwork.com</a>
                                Unikwork Systems will send any Notice of Dispute to you by mail to your address if we
                                have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and Unikwork Systems will attempt to
                                resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date
                                the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or Unikwork Systems may
                                commence arbitration.</p>

                            <h5>Binding Arbitration</h5>
                            <p>If you and Unikwork Systems don’t resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other
                                effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as
                                described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as
                                a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. The dispute shall
                                be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of
                                the American Arbitration Association. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary
                                injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the
                                party’s rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. Any and all legal,
                                accounting, and other costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the prevailing party shall
                                be borne by the non-prevailing party.</p>

                            <h5>Submissions and Privacy</h5>
                            <p>In the event that you submit or post any ideas, creative suggestions, designs,
                                photographs, information, advertisements, data or proposals, including ideas for new or
                                improved products, services, features, technologies or promotions, you expressly agree
                                that such submissions will automatically be treated as non-confidential and
                                non-proprietary and will become the sole property of Unikwork Systems without any
                                compensation or credit to you whatsoever. Unikwork Systems and its affiliates shall have
                                no obligations with respect to such submissions or posts and may use the ideas contained
                                in such submissions or posts for any purposes in any medium in perpetuity, including,
                                but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services using
                                such ideas.</p>

                            <h5>Promotions</h5>
                            <p>Unikwork Systems may, from time to time, include contests, promotions, sweepstakes, or
                                other activities (“Promotions”) that require you to submit material or information
                                concerning yourself. Please note that all Promotions may be governed by separate rules
                                that may contain certain eligibility requirements, such as restrictions as to age and
                                geographic location. You are responsible to read all Promotions rules to determine
                                whether or not you are eligible to participate. If you enter any Promotion, you agree to
                                abide by and to comply with all Promotions Rules.</p>
                            <p>Additional terms and conditions may apply to purchases of goods or services on or through
                                the Services, which terms and conditions are made a part of this Agreement by this
                                reference.</p>

                            <h5>Typographical Errors</h5>
                            <p>In the event a product and/or service is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect
                                information due to typographical error, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any
                                orders placed for the product and/or service listed at the incorrect price. We shall
                                have the right to refuse or cancel any such order whether or not the order has been
                                confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for
                                the purchase and your order is canceled, we shall immediately issue a credit to your
                                credit card account or other payment account in the amount of the charge.</p>

                            <h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
                            <p>If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of
                                these Terms & Conditions to be unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms & Conditions
                                will continue in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms &
                                Conditions will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized
                                representative of Unikwork Systems. Unikwork Systems will be entitled to injunctive or
                                other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the
                                event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. Unikwork Systems operates and
                                controls the Unikwork Systems Service from its offices in IN. The Service is not
                                intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
                                country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation.
                                Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Unikwork Systems Service from other
                                locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with
                                local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. These Terms & Conditions
                                (which include and incorporate the Unikwork Systems Privacy Policy) contains the entire
                                understanding, and supersedes all prior understandings, between you and Unikwork Systems
                                concerning its subject matter, and cannot be changed or modified by you. The section
                                headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not be given any legal
                                import.</p>
